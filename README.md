# DrawingPracticeTool

Online drawing practice tools give little control, especially over which images you are going to use. This tool lets you use whatever images you want and set a custom number of seconds per image.

NOTE: Only tested on Windows

1) Download and unzip the latest release
2) Create a folder and dump the images you want to use into it
3) Launch the program (choose a 16x9 resolution like 1920x1080)
4) Enter number of seconds per image into the input field labeled "Seconds". This will be saved to a file and reloaded so you don't have to do it every time you launch.
5) Copy and paste the location of your folder (something like "C:\Users\Your_User_Name\Desktop\Your_Directory_Name") full of images into the input field labeled "Image Directory". This will be saved to a file and reloaded so you don't have to do it every time you launch.
6) Press Start
7) Draw :)
